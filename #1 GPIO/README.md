# General Purpose Input / Output ( GPIO )

### GPIO pins are configurable electronic pins that can be set to either input or output mode :

• When set as inputs, they can detect and read signals from external devices, such as sensors, switches, or buttons. 

• When set as outputs, they can send electrical signals to control or drive external devices like LEDs, motors, relays, or other electronic circuits.
