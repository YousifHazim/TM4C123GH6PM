## UART Introduction

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a widely used communication protocol for serial data transmission between devices.

It provides a simple and efficient means of transmitting and receiving data over a serial interface. 

UART communication is often employed in various applications, including microcontroller-based systems, 

embedded devices, computer peripherals, and communication between different devices.

## The key characteristics of UART

### • Asynchronous Communication :

UART operates in an asynchronous manner, meaning that data is transmitted without a common clock signal between the sending and receiving devices. 

Instead, each byte of data is framed with a start bit and a stop bit, allowing the receiver to synchronize with the transmitted data.

### • Data Format :

UART transmits data in fixed-size units, typically 8 bits per byte. 

It uses a specific data format that includes the data bits, start bit, stop bit(s), and optional parity bit for error checking. 

The start bit indicates the beginning of a data byte, while the stop bit(s) mark its end. Parity bit, if used, provides basic error detection.

### • Baud Rate :

The baud rate specifies the speed at which data is transmitted over the UART interface. 

It represents the number of bits per second (bps) that can be transmitted. 

Both the transmitting and receiving devices must be configured with the same baud rate to communicate properly.

### • Serial Interface :

UART uses two lines for communication: a transmit line (TX) and a receive line (RX). 

The transmitting device sends data on the TX line, while the receiving device reads data from the RX line. 

The TX and RX lines are connected between the devices to establish the serial communication link.

### • Flow Control :

UART does not inherently provide flow control mechanisms to manage the flow of data between devices. 

However, hardware flow control can be implemented using additional control lines, 

such as RTS (Request to Send) and CTS (Clear to Send), to signal when data can be sent or received.

### • UART Registers :

UART communication is typically controlled through specific registers provided by the microcontroller or communication module. 

These registers allow configuration of baud rate, data format, interrupt handling, and data transmission/reception.

### • Applications :

UART is widely used in various applications, including communication between microcontrollers, 

interfacing with sensors, wireless modules, GPS receivers, and many other devices that require serial communication.
